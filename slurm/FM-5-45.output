Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [rates, switchpoints]
Sampling 4 chains for 200_000 tune and 200_000 draw iterations (800_000 + 800_000 draws total) took 90006 seconds.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.01 for some parameters. This indicates problems during sampling. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
The effective sample size per chain is smaller than 100 for some parameters.  A higher number is needed for reliable rhat and ess computation. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
There were 39994 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
Chain 0 reached the maximum tree depth. Increase `max_treedepth`, increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
Chain 1 reached the maximum tree depth. Increase `max_treedepth`, increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
Chain 2 reached the maximum tree depth. Increase `max_treedepth`, increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
Chain 3 reached the maximum tree depth. Increase `max_treedepth`, increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
